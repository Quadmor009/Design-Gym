Redesign the Design Gym landing page to feel more alive and energetic.

Product context:
Design Gym is a practice platform where designers sharpen their visual judgment through comparison-based challenges.
It should feel active, creative, and motivating — like training for your eye.

Tone:
- Energetic but refined
- Confident, modern, creative
- Feels like a place designers want to return to

Visual direction:
- Introduce color intentionally (not just black and white)
- Use bold typography for the hero
- Add visual contrast and rhythm
- Make the page feel dynamic, not static

Imagery:
- Use placeholder images or blocks for now
- Suggest where interface screenshots or typographic visuals would live
- Images should support learning and practice, not decoration

Layout ideas:
- Hero with strong headline + visual element
- Split sections (text on one side, visual on the other)
- Sections that alternate alignment to create movement
- Clear visual flow from top to CTA

CTA:
- Still one primary CTA
- CTA should feel motivating and active
- Use color and scale to make it stand out

Styling constraints:
- Use Tailwind CSS
- No heavy animations, but subtle motion is allowed (hover, transitions)
- Avoid cheesy fitness metaphors or icons
- Keep everything professional and design-forward

Technical requirements:
- Use Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Desktop-first
- Show full code for the page component
- Clearly mark where real images or screenshots can be swapped in later
- Explain the visual decisions briefly
