Create a quiz data system for a design judgment game.

The game tests a designer’s ability to evaluate interfaces and visual design.

Use a data-driven approach.

–––––––––––––––––
DATA STRUCTURE
–––––––––––––––––

Create a data file (e.g. quizData.ts or quizData.json) with 20 total questions.

Each question should follow this structure:

{
  id: number,
  level: "beginner" | "mid",
  category: "interface-comparison",
  question: string,
  promptContext: string,
  leftImage: string,
  rightImage: string,
  correctAnswer: "left" | "right",
  principlesTested: string[],
  explanation: string
}

DIFFICULTY DEFINITION
–––––––––––––––––

BEGINNER LEVEL (10 QUESTIONS)

Beginner questions should:
- Test obvious, foundational design principles
- Have a clearly correct answer
- Focus on visual clarity, not nuance
- Avoid trade-offs

Beginner principles include:
- Visual hierarchy
- Contrast
- Alignment
- Spacing
- Readability
- Primary vs secondary actions

Beginner explanations should:
- Be direct and instructional
- Explicitly name the principle being applied
- Explain what is working and what is not
- Avoid subjective language

Example beginner question intent:
"Which interface has clearer visual hierarchy for a first-time user?"

–––––––––––––––––

MID LEVEL (10 QUESTIONS)

Mid-level questions should:
- Introduce trade-offs and nuance
- Test contextual decision-making
- Require understanding of user intent
- Sometimes include two “good” designs, with one being more appropriate

Mid-level principles include:
- Information density
- Progressive disclosure
- Affordance
- Consistency vs emphasis
- Contextual hierarchy
- Cognitive load

Mid-level explanations should:
- Acknowledge why the other option might seem correct
- Explain why one choice is more appropriate for the given context
- Focus on decision rationale, not absolute rules

Example mid-level question intent:
"Which interface better supports a returning user completing a task quickly?"

–––––––––––––––––
LOGIC REQUIREMENTS
–––––––––––––––––

Include logic-ready fields so the app can:
- Filter questions by level
- Track performance per level
- Easily add future levels (e.g. advanced)

Ensure:
- Each level has balanced principles coverage
- No repeated question framing
- Image filenames are placeholders (e.g. /images/beginner-01-left.png)

–––––––––––––––––
OUTPUT
–––––––––––––––––

Generate:
- The full quiz data file
- 20 complete questions
- Clear, principle-focused explanations
- Clean, readable formatting

Do not include UI code.
Focus only on quiz content and structure.
