I have no coding experience.

Build a simple design quiz web app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Use the Pages Router and show me the full code for:
- pages/index.tsx
- any supporting files needed for the quiz to work

The app should:
- Display a design question
- Show two interface images side by side
- Allow the user to select left or right
- Show which answer is more correct and why
- Include a “Next question” button

Use placeholder images.
Keep the UI minimal and editorial.
Explain only what I need to run the app.
